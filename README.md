# Cofiblocks

*Ensuring a fairer future for small-scale coffee producers through blockchain technology.*

## The Problem

Small-scale coffee farmers worldwide are abandoning their land. Complex supply chains and low profitability make their business unsustainable, threatening the diversity and quality of the coffee we love. A lack of transparency and an excess of intermediaries prevent the generated value from reaching the people who actually grow the beans.

## The Cofiblocks Solution

`Cofiblocks` reimagines this supply chain using the transparency and efficiency of the blockchain. We create a direct, traceable link between the producer and the end consumer, ensuring that value flows back to those who matter most: the farmers.

## How It Works

1.  **Tokenization:** Each batch of coffee from a verified producer is tokenized into a series of NFTs (**ERC1155 Standard**) via the `CofiCollection.sol` contract. Each token represents ownership of one package of coffee (e.g., 250g), with its origin and variety guaranteed.

2.  **Marketplace:** These tokens are listed on our marketplace, where consumers can purchase the coffee directly from the producer, knowing exactly where it comes from.

3.  **Direct Payment:** The payment for the sale (in USDC or ETH) is transferred directly to the producer's digital wallet, cutting out unnecessary middlemen.

4.  **Profit Sharing:** In addition to direct sales, 30% of the profits generated by the `cofiblocks` platform are redistributed to the small-scale producers, creating a more equitable and sustainable business model.

## Core Smart Contract Features

The `cofiblocks` core is built with secure and efficient smart contracts, focusing on security and good governance.

* **ERC1155 Standard:** Perfectly suited for representing batches of coffee, where each package from the same lot is identical and interchangeable. This allows for efficient batch transfers.

* **Granular Access Control:** Implements the `AccessControl` pattern to define specific roles (`MINTER_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, `UPGRADER_ROLE`), ensuring that only authorized entities can perform sensitive actions.

* **Upgradeable:** Built with the UUPS proxy pattern (ERC1967), allowing the contract logic to be improved in the future without losing user data or changing the contract's public address.

* **Pausable:** The system can be paused in case of an emergency to halt all token transfers, protecting user funds and assets.

## Tech Stack
